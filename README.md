This code is an exploration of optimizing matrix multiplication in JavaScript.

See the [blog post](http://hobinjk.github.io/2015/12/01/low-level-high-level-optimization/) or the [commit
history](https://github.com/hobinjk/matrix-optimization/commits/master) for a
detailed look at the techniques employed. This entire project would not be
possible without the excellent MIT class 6.172: Performance Engineering of
Software Systems. All of the low-level techniques employed stem directly from
the first lecture of 6.172.
